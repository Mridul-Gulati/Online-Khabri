In a startling turn of events, an eyewitness has spoken out about the alarming security breaches that unfolded during Donald Trump's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where gunshots rang out, sending shockwaves through the crowd. The witness, who alerted the police about the shooter, has painted a chilling account of the incident, raising serious questions about the safety measures in place.

## Eyewitness Report: A Chilling Sequence of Events

> "We observed him slithering up the roof of the adjacent building, a mere 50 feet from us," the witness recounted to the BBC, his voice still trembling with disbelief. Despite informing the officers about the suspicious individual, he was met with a baffling lack of response. "They seemed clueless," he lamented.

The witness watched in growing horror as the shooter stealthily made his way onto the roof. "We could clearly see him brandishing a rifle," he said. "I was dumbstruck, pointing at him frantically, but Trump kept speaking. The Secret Service seemed oblivious, gazing down at us from the barn's summit."

## Seconds of Panic and Chaos

"Time seemed to slow down as five deafening shots shattered the air," the witness continued. "I saw Trump recoil, his right ear bleeding profusely. The realization that everyone's life was in danger hit me like a ton of bricks."

## Security Questions Unraveled

The eyewitness's account has raised red flags about the security arrangements at the rally. "Where were the Secret Service agents on all the roofs?" he questioned, his tone tinged with frustration. "How could the shooter evade detection and infiltrate the event grounds?"

## Investigation Intensifies

Butler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger confirmed that the shooter was located outside the event perimeter. 
> "We're determined to unravel how he gained access," he said.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has taken over the investigation. "The FBI is committed to ensuring a thorough and impartial probe into this incident," a spokesperson stated.

## Trump's Response and Aftermath

Trump, despite the terrifying ordeal, reportedly expressed relief upon being informed that he was unharmed. He underwent a medical checkup and was later released.

The incident has served as a stark reminder of the ever-present threat to public safety during political gatherings. As the investigation unfolds, it remains crucial to evaluate the security measures and identify any vulnerabilities that could have been exploited.
