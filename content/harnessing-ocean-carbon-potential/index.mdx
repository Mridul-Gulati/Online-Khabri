In a groundbreaking development, researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras) have identified the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal as potential reservoirs for carbon dioxide (CO2) storage. This groundbreaking discovery could pave the way for India's decarbonization efforts and accelerate the country's journey towards net-zero emissions by 2070.

Titled **"Oceans as Carbon Sinks: India's Untapped Potential,"** the article delves into the research conducted at IIT Madras and its implications for India's climate goals. Led by Professor Jitendra Sangwai, the team's findings offer hope for mitigating India's carbon footprint while ensuring environmental sustainability.

## The Scientific Edge

Professor Sangwai's team has established that the Bay of Bengal alone can absorb several hundred giga tonnes of anthropogenic CO2. This remarkable capacity, equivalent to years of India's greenhouse gas emissions, presents a significant opportunity to address the country's carbon challenge.

When CO2 is stored in the ocean, it forms an eco-friendly substance called 'gas hydrates.' These ice-like structures have the remarkable ability to sequester vast amounts of CO2. Under oceanic conditions below 500 meters, a single cubic meter of gas hydrate can capture up to 170 cubic meters of CO2.

## Permanent Storage: Beyond 2,800 Meters

The research team's findings extend beyond shallow depths. At depths exceeding 2,800 meters, CO2 can be stored permanently as liquid pools and solid hydrates. This eliminates any risk of reemission into the atmosphere, creating a safe and long-lasting carbon sink.

## Unlocking Collaboration and Investment

IIT Madras is actively engaging with government and industry stakeholders to secure research funding and foster collaboration for large-scale CO2 sequestration. The ultimate goal is to support carbon-intensive industries in transitioning to carbon neutrality, reducing their environmental impact.

## Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS): A Viable Solution

Experts recognize CCS technology as a promising tool for managing CO2 emissions. Until a reliable and carbon-free energy alternative emerges, CCS offers a practical solution to curb carbon emissions while safeguarding the environment.

## The Role of the Paris Agreement and Net-Zero Pledges

The Paris Agreement, signed by over 190 countries, commits nations to reduce carbon emissions in pursuit of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius or, ideally, 1.5 degrees Celsius. India, along with other countries, has pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070.

However, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has expressed concern that current global commitments still fall short of the necessary reductions to meet the 1.5-degree Celsius target. The continued reliance on fossil fuels threatens to undermine these goals.

## Synergy with Natural Solutions

While CCS technology offers a promising avenue for carbon mitigation, it is crucial to emphasize the importance of natural solutions, such as afforestation and forest conservation. These measures enhance the carbon sink capacity of the planet, providing a sustainable long-term strategy to combat climate change.
