## NISAR: Earth Observation Mission

The partnership between NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) extends beyond astronaut training. Garcetti also announced the upcoming launch of the NISAR satellite from ISRO's Satish Dhawan Space Center. NISAR, a joint Earth-observing mission, will monitor various aspects of our planet, including ecosystems, the Earth's surface, natural hazards, sea level rise, and the cryosphere.
