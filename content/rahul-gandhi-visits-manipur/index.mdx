Imphal, June 6 (IANS): Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will embark on a tour of Manipur on Monday to meet the victims of the recent violence that has plagued the state. This will be his third visit to the troubled region and his first as the leader of the opposition.

## Journey to the Heart of the Conflict

Gandhi will commence his journey from Delhi to Silchar by air. From there, he will proceed to the conflict-ridden district of Jiribam, where fresh violence erupted on June 6. The opposition leader is expected to visit relief camps and interact with those affected by the turmoil.

> "Gandhi's presence in Manipur sends a strong message of solidarity with the people who have suffered," 

said K Meghachandra, the state Congress president.
> "He is determined to understand their plight and lend his support."

## Reaching Out to Victims

After visiting Jiribam, Gandhi will return to Silchar and fly to Imphal, the state capital. In Imphal, he will head to Churachandpur district, where thousands have taken refuge in relief camps. The Congress leader will personally listen to their stories and offer words of comfort.

> "Gandhi's compassion has always been evident in times of crisis," noted O Ibobi Singh, the leader of the Congress legislature party. "His visit to Manipur will provide much-needed hope to those who have lost everything."

## Personal Encounters

Gandhi will also visit Moirang in Bishnupur district, where he will interact with victims at relief camps. This marks his third visit to Manipur since the outbreak of violence last year.

> "Gandhi has a deep understanding of the complex issues facing Manipur," said Meghachandra. "As the opposition leader, he carries a profound responsibility to advocate for peace and justice."

## Meeting with Governor

Before departing from Imphal, Gandhi is scheduled to meet with Governor Anusuiya Uikey to discuss the situation in the state and explore ways to restore tranquility.

> "Gandhi's visit is an important step towards finding a lasting solution to the unrest in Manipur," said Singh. "His voice will resonate with the people and help bring about meaningful change."
