## The Triumph of Innocence

In a resounding victory for justice, a Pakistani court has acquitted former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, in a controversial un-Islamic marriage case. This case had been the sole impediment to Khan's release from prison since last August.

## A Contentious Complaint

The case stemmed from a complaint filed in 2023 by Bushra Bibi's ex-husband, Khawar Fareed Maneka. Maneka alleged that Khan and Bushra had married during Bushra's Iddat period, a sacred waiting period in Islam after a woman's divorce or widowhood.

## Challenging the Verdict

Khan and Bibi vehemently contested the conviction. They sought a review of the lower court's decision in a district court in Islamabad. After a thorough examination of the case, Judge Afzal Majoka delivered a decisive judgment in the afternoon, overturning the previous verdict and exonerating both Khan and his wife.

## A Momentous Ruling

> "This is a triumph for the independent judiciary," exclaimed Gohar Khan, the PTI party chief. "All these cases were fabricated, and Imran Khan will prevail in all others as well."

The judge ordered the immediate release of Khan and Bushra, noting that they were no longer held for any other offense. This ruling marks a significant milestone in Khan's legal battles, as it clears the path for his eventual release from prison.

## A History of Persecution

Khan has faced a relentless onslaught of legal challenges since his ouster from power last year. The un-Islamic marriage case was one of several charges brought against him in a suspected attempt to discredit him and derail his political aspirations.

## A Resurgence of Hope

This latest victory has infused the PTI party and Khan's supporters with renewed optimism. It is seen as a vindication of Khan's unwavering commitment to justice and a blow to his detractors who sought to malign his character.

As the legal battles surrounding Khan continue, this acquittal stands as a testament to the resilience of the Pakistani justice system and the indomitable spirit of those who dare to challenge authority.
