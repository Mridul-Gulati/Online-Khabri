In the aftermath of Mumbai Indians' narrow victory over Punjab Kings in the IPL, former all-rounder Irfan Pathan has shed light on a concerning trend within the franchise. Pathan's incisive observations during commentary on Star Sports laid bare a fundamental flaw in the team's leadership structure.

## Hardik Pandya vs Rohit Sharma

During a crucial over in the Punjab Kings' innings, pacer Akash Madhwal found himself torn between two leaders - captain Hardik Pandya and former skipper Rohit Sharma. To Pathan's dismay, Madhwal's unwavering gaze was fixed solely on Sharma, as if Pandya were an invisible presence.

>> "It was a stark illustration of Madhwal's perception of leadership," Pathan lamented. "He saw Rohit Sharma as his true captain, not Hardik Pandya. This is a dangerous mindset that needs to be corrected immediately."

The consequences of this fractured dynamic were painfully evident in Mumbai Indians' recent defeat to Rajasthan Royals, which extended their losing streak to five matches. Pathan believes it's imperative for Pandya to assert his authority and instill confidence in his players.

>> "Hardik Pandya is a capable leader," Pathan emphasized. "He needs to step up and make it clear that he's in charge. That means demanding respect from his teammates, including Madhwal. It's not just about winning matches; it's about creating a cohesive unit that can withstand the inevitable challenges of the IPL."
