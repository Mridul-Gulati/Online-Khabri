Amidst the fanfare, Bachchan candidly revealed that it was the unwavering determination of Hridyanath Mangeshkar that had persuaded him to grace the occasion, making amends for his absence the previous year due to an alleged ailment.

During his poignant acceptance speech, Amitabh Bachchan shared a captivating anecdote from the annals of time, shedding light on the pivotal moment that set the trajectory for his international concert career.

## In 1981...

It was an evening in 1981, during a visit to New York, that fate intertwined the paths of the screen icon and the musical legend. Lata Mangeshkar, with her ethereal presence, sought Amitabh Bachchan's brief appearance on stage to introduce her. Little did she know that her simple request would ignite a spark that would forever alter the course of his destiny.

As Bachchan was about to make his departure, Lata Mangeshkar, intrigued by whispers of his recent song in the film 'Laawaris,' earnestly implored him to render it live. Without hesitation, Bachchan took to the stage and poured his soul into the evergreen track "Mere Angne Mein." The audience's thunderous applause was a revelation for Bachchan's close friend, who foresaw a future of international concerts beckoning the megastar.
