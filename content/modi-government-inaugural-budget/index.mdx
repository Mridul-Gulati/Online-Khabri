## Section 2: CII's Blueprint for Employment Generation

Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has emerged from the woodwork with its Pre-Budget 2024 memorandum, outlining crucial measures to catalyze employment generation:

* Employment Linked Incentive Scheme: Drawing inspiration from the manufacturing sector's PLI success story, CII proposes an Employment Linked Incentive Scheme tailored to labor-intensive service sectors like tourism, hospitality, logistics, retail, and entertainment.

* International Mobility Authority: Inspired by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, CII envisions an "International Mobility Authority" under the Ministry of External Affairs to cater to Indian workers employed abroad.

* Skill Development Study: CII underscores the need for a comprehensive study to identify skill gaps in the Indian workforce vis-Ã -vis international labor market shortages. Based on findings, targeted skill upgradation schemes will be initiated, including cultural training for countries with significant labor demands.

## Section 3: India's Demographic Dividend: A Golden Opportunity

As the world's most populous nation, securing employment is paramount for India. These measures, if embraced, will galvanize the government's efforts to harness India's demographic dividend.
