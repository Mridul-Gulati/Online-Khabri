In the ongoing Indian Premier League season, high-scoring matches have become the norm, with the 12th score surpassing 200 runs when the Delhi Capitals amassed a formidable 224 for 4 against the Gujarat Titans on Wednesday. Gujarat Titans captain Shubman Gill sees the Impact Player rule as a contributing factor to this run-fest.

> "The Impact Player provides an extra layer of support for batters, allowing them to play with greater freedom and aggression against the bowlers," Gill explained after his team's four-run loss. "This cushion gives batters the confidence to push the boundaries, knowing there's still a cushion of backup if they take risks."

## Titans' Struggle Continues...
Despite a strong start, the Gujarat Titans bowlers faltered in the latter overs, allowing Rishabh Pant and Axar Patel to stitch together a match-defining 113-run partnership. Gill acknowledged that his bowlers gave away a few too many runs, particularly in the final overs.

> "We initially felt confident in restricting Delhi to around 200-210, but we let some runs slip away in the last few overs," Gill said. "However, the advantage of chasing is having a clear target. On this small ground, anything is chaseable. It all comes down to execution for the bowlers."

## Upcoming matches
The Gujarat Titans will face the Royal Challengers Bengaluru in their next match on Sunday. As the tournament progresses, Gill's insights on the Impact Player rule and his team's performance will add depth to our understanding of the high-scoring matches and the tactical challenges faced by players.
