## Opening Surge:

The Indian equity markets witnessed a historic opening on Wednesday, with both the BSE Sensex and Nifty50 reaching unprecedented levels. The Sensex soared to an all-time peak of 80,481.36, while the Nifty50 touched a new high of 24,461.05. However, this initial euphoria proved short-lived.

## Midday Dip:

By 9:20 AM, the markets had reversed course, with the Sensex shedding 156 points or 0.19% to trade at 80,195.88. The Nifty50 mirrored this decline, slipping by 36 points or 0.15% to 24,397.40.

## Analyst Outlook:

Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities believes the Nifty's positive trend remains intact. He notes that the index has breached a crucial resistance level of 24,400 and predicts a potential rally to 24,960 in the near future. However, support remains at 24,250.

Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal adds that markets are expected to maintain a positive bias, influenced by upcoming inflation data, Q1FY25 earnings, and the budget. The pharma sector is likely to garner attention due to its attractive valuations and anticipated earnings growth.

## Global Markets:

Overseas markets presented a mixed picture. S&P 500 futures remained stable, while Japan's Topix remained flat. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined by 0.5%, and Euro Stoxx 50 futures advanced by 0.3%.

## Currency Watch:

The dollar rebounded on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested caution regarding the timing of potential interest rate cuts. Traders kept a close eye on the New Zealand dollar for indications about the central bank's rate decision.

## F&O Ban Stocks:

Several stocks have been placed under the F&O ban today, including India Cements, IEX, ABFRL, Bandhan Bank, PEL, GNFC, Chambal Fertilisers, Indus Tower, and Balrampur Chini Mills.

## Investor Sentiment:

Foreign portfolio investors emerged as net buyers, purchasing shares worth Rs 314 crore on Tuesday. Domestic institutional investors also contributed to the market inflow, acquiring shares valued at Rs 1,416 crore. The net long position of FIIs increased from Rs 3.77 lakh crore on Monday to Rs 3.85 lakh crore on Tuesday.
