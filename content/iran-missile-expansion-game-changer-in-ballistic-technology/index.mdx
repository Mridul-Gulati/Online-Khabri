## Behind Closed Walls: The Expansion of Missile Factories

Amidst the shadows of the Modarres military base and Khojir missile production complex, Iran's secret plans to bolster its ballistic missile prowess have been brought to light. Satellite imagery captured by Planet Labs has revealed more than 30 new structures, each veiled from the outside world by towering dirt berms. These berms serve as silent guardians, designed to protect against the catastrophic explosions of a missile assembly gone awry.

## A Testifying Trio: Iranian Officials Confirm the Arsenal's Growth

Three senior Iranian officials, their voices echoing through the halls of confidential meetings, have corroborated the satellite's startling revelations. In hushed tones, they acknowledge the expansion's purpose: to ramp up the production of conventional ballistic missiles. One official dares to question, "Why shouldn't we?"

## Missiles as a Weapon of Trade and Power

Iran's missile expansion extends beyond its borders, playing a pivotal role in the global arms trade. According to Reuters, Iran has supplied Russia with a formidable arsenal of surface-to-surface ballistic missiles, including the Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar. These weapons have become a game-changer in Russia's relentless campaign against Ukraine.

## Concerns Arise: US and Israel on High Alert

## Iran's Missile Ambitions: A Balancing Act

Iran's decision to expand its missile capabilities is a calculated gamble. While it bolsters their defenses and opens new avenues for arms deals, it also invites greater scrutiny from the international community. The United States remains adamant in its commitment to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and the missile expansion serves as a stern reminder of the delicate balance at play in the region.

## The Future of Ballistic Missile Technology

As the dust settles on this latest revelation, the future of ballistic missile technology hangs in the balance. Iran's expansion has undoubtedly reshaped the geopolitical landscape, and it remains to be seen how the world will respond to this evolving threat.
