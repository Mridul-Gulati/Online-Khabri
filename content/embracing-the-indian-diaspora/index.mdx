The United States Ambassador to India, Eric Garcetti, has hailed the extraordinary success of Indian immigrants in the United States. His observation that over 10% of Fortune 500 company CEOs are Indian immigrants who studied in the US underscores a remarkable shift in corporate America.

> "The narrative has completely flipped," remarked Garcetti. "Once deemed underrepresented, Indians now dominate the C-suites of leading tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Starbucks."

## Education: A Bridge Between Nations

The ambassador highlighted the paramount importance of people-to-people ties, especially through educational exchanges. He emphasized the enduring impact of studying in the US, which often fosters lifelong connections between individuals and nations.

> "Indian students flock to American universities, eager to embrace our world-class education," said Garcetti. "These exchanges not only shape their careers but also build bridges of understanding between our two countries."

## Easing Visa Challenges

Addressing the issue of visa wait times, the ambassador acknowledged President Joe Biden's directive to expedite the process for Indian applicants.

> "President Biden has made it a top priority," Garcetti stated. "This reflects the overwhelming desire among Americans to strengthen our relationship with India."

The ambassador acknowledged the logistical challenges but framed them as a testament to the growing demand for US education among Indian students. He noted that in 2023, the US issued a record-breaking 140,000 student visas to Indians.

## A Path to Personal and Professional Growth

At a pre-departure orientation for Indian students, Garcetti underscored the transformative power of educational exchanges.

> "These experiences empower students to expand their horizons, connect with diverse cultures, and develop a global perspective," he said.

The ambassador's words resonated with the students gathered at the American Center, each eager to embark on their own journey of personal and professional growth in the United States.
