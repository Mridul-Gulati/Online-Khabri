As the grand wedding celebrations for Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant continue, the Ambani abode witnessed a more intimate affair on Wednesday. A special Shiv puja was organized, bringing together a select group of loved ones, family, and a few renowned personalities.

## Traditional Splendor at Puja and Mehendi

For the puja and a subsequent mehendi ceremony, the celebrities adorned themselves in exquisite ethnic attire. Bollywood sensation Ananya Panday captivated onlookers in a regal aubergine lehenga with intricate gold accents. The V-neckline blouse showcased intricate gold embroidery, complemented by a flowing dupatta. An opulent jadau necklace and golden jhumkas completed her ensemble.

Curiously, this captivating lehenga had graced none other than the legendary Madhuri Dixit in March 2024 at an illustrious event. The Bollywood icon had paired it with a longer silk top and adorned it with a dazzling diamond and sapphire necklace.

## A Tale of Two Style Icons

The juxtaposition of the two fashionistas donning the same lehenga sparked a lively debate: who wore it better?

## Star-Studded Guest List

The pre-wedding festivities drew a constellation of celebrities, including the charismatic Ranveer Singh, the radiant Janhvi Kapoor, and the poised Shanaya Kapoor.

## Ceremonies Galore

The main wedding ceremonies are set to commence on Friday, July 12, with the auspicious Shubh Vivah, the primary wedding function. The celebrations will culminate on Saturday, July 13, with Shubh Aashirwad, where blessings will be bestowed upon the newlyweds. The grand finale, Mangal Utsav or the wedding reception, will take place on Sunday, July 14.
