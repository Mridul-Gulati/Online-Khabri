## Political Turmoil in Kurukshetra

In the historic city of Kurukshetra, former Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Singh Chautala of the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) unleashed a barrage of criticism against the state government led by Nayab Singh Saini.

## Government in a Constant State of Flux

> "The Saini-led government is exhibiting a remarkable talent for indecision, making repeated U-turns on policies established by its predecessor under Manohar Lal Khattar," Chautala declared. "Their anxiety is palpable, reflecting the dwindling public support for their administration."

## Issues of Contention

Chautala cited several instances where the government had reversed its stance, including the controversial stilt plus four-floor construction policy and the implementation of the Parivar Pehchan Patra infrastructure. He emphasized that these changes were indicative of a leadership that had lost the confidence of the people.

## Questioning the INLD-BSP Alliance

With regard to the recently forged alliance between the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Chautala expressed skepticism. "This political maneuver appears to be a calculated arrangement," he said. "Time will tell who is truly orchestrating this partnership."

## JJP's Plans

Regarding JJP's own electoral strategy, Chautala remained coy. "We are diligently canvassing all 90 constituencies across the state," he stated. "Once this process is complete, we will unveil our future course of action."

## Law and Order Woes

Chautala also condemned the recent murder of a JJP worker in Hansi, describing it as a testament to the deteriorating law and order situation in Haryana. 
> "Despite the presence of a government bodyguard, such an incident could occur, highlighting the abysmal failure of the authorities," he said.

> "History has shown that when the masses yearn for transformation, extraordinary shifts occur," Chautala concluded. "The upcoming assembly elections will undoubtedly witness a significant change in the political landscape of Haryana."
