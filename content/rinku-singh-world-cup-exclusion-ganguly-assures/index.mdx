Former Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly has offered solace to rising star Rinku Singh after his omission from the Indian squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup. Ganguly explained that the team management's decision was purely strategic, prioritizing an extra spinner in anticipation of the spinning conditions in the West Indies.

## Ganguly's Perspective: Spin a Factor in Selection

> "Considering the conditions in the West Indies, where the wickets are likely to favor spin, the selectors opted for an additional spinner," Ganguly said at the Trophy unveiling ceremony of the Bengal Pro T20 League. "This decision may have impacted Rinku's selection."

Despite Rinku's explosive batting and remarkable strike rate of over 176 in 15 T20Is, he was overshadowed by the team's strategic choice. 
> "It's just the beginning for Rinku," Ganguly emphasized. "This setback should not discourage him."

## India and Australia: Dominance Expected

Ganguly predicted that India and Australia would be the frontrunners in the tournament, much like they were in last year's 50-over World Cup. "Both teams are packed with match-winners," he said. "I expect them to dominate in the USA and the West Indies."

> "It's a fabulous team with players capable of winning matches single-handedly. All 15 players are deserving of a place, and I trust Rohit Sharma and Rahul Dravid to select the best combination."

Alongside the World Cup discussion, the announcement of the eight franchises and their marquee players for the Bengal Pro T20 League was made. The inaugural edition will kick off in Eden Gardens and Jadavpur University Salt Lake Campus ground from June 11-28, featuring some of the most talented cricketers in Bengal.
