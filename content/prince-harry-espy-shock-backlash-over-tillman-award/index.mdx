## Controversial Choice

Prince Harry's selection as the 2024 ESPY recipient for the Pat Tillman Award has ignited a firestorm of protest. The announcement by ESPN has drawn flak from various quarters, with the most poignant criticism coming from Mary Tillman, the late hero's mother.

Mary's disbelief at the decision is understandable. She questions why a **"divisive individual"** like Harry, who has courted controversy with his recent memoirs, would be chosen for an award honoring her heroic son. She argues that there are countless more deserving candidates, particularly those unsung heroes within the veteran community who quietly make a difference.

## ESPN's Defense

In the face of the mounting backlash, ESPN has defended its decision, citing Prince Harry's work with the Invictus Games as a cause worthy of celebration. The games, founded by Harry, are a Paralympic-style competition for wounded, injured, and sick military personnel and veterans.

## Public Outcry

However, ESPN's justification has fallen on deaf ears. A petition demanding a reconsideration has garnered thousands of signatures, and former NFL star Pat McAfee has expressed his disapproval, accusing ESPN of deliberately stoking outrage. McAfee suggests a separate category for the Duke, such as *"ESPY for Royal Family Member Who Loves Sports."*

## Harry's Disappointment

Sources close to Harry reveal that he is "stunned" by the negative response to his award. He had believed that his work with the Invictus Games, his military service, and his commitment to veterans would overshadow any personal controversies.

## Missed Opportunity

The controversy surrounding this award has turned the spotlight away from the true heroes: the veterans and their families whom the Pat Tillman Award should honor. It is a missed opportunity to celebrate the selfless sacrifices made by those who have served our country with valor and distinction.
