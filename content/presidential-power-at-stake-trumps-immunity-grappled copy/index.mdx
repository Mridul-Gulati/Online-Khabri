Google's Doodle on April 29, 2024, celebrated the enchanting Indonesian dance form of Tari Rangkuk Alu, a testament to the ingenuity and cultural heritage of the Manggarai people.

## Roots in Traditional Play

Tari Rangkuk Alu evolved from a traditional game called "Rangkuk Alu," a lively competition where participants navigate a grid of bamboo poles pulsating to a rhythmic beat. The dance form emerged as spectators recognized the artistry and grace inherent in the game's intricate footwork.

## A Dance of Agility and Rhythm

Novice dancers start with simple patterns, while seasoned performers weave through a labyrinth of bamboo poles moving in unison. The rhythmic accompaniment of drums and xylophones provides an invigorating backdrop, while dancers don colorful skirts, vibrant headdresses, and flowing scarves. Concentration and agility are paramount, as dancers strive to avoid contact with the moving bamboo.
