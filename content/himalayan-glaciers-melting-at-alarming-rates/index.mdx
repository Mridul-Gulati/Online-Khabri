Amidst the towering grandeur of the Himalayas, often hailed as the "Third Pole" for its icy crown, a chilling revelation emerges: glaciers are vanishing at an unprecedented pace, leaving behind a trail of expanding glacial lakes that pose a growing peril.

## From the Space
Satellite imagery unveils the stark reality of this glacial retreat. Since 1984, a staggering 2,431 glacial lakes larger than 10 hectares have been spotted across the Indian Himalayan region, with 676 of them witnessing a dramatic growth in size. This includes 130 lakes within India's borders, a sobering reminder of the impacts climate change is exacting on our mountain ecosystems.

## Glacial Lakes are expanding
The expansion of these glacial lakes is not merely an environmental concern but a looming threat to downstream communities. As glaciers melt, the swelling lakes accumulate water that can burst forth in catastrophic Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs). These floods can unleash a torrential force, sweeping away homes, infrastructure, and livelihoods.

To grasp the magnitude of this glacial retreat, consider the Ghepan Ghat lake in Himachal Pradesh. Its area has ballooned by a staggering **178%** since 1989, growing from **36.49 hectares to a sprawling 101.3 hectares**. This alarming expansion highlights the perilous rate at which glaciers are melting, altering the very landscape of the Himalayas.

The expansion of glacial lakes is not uniform across the region. Higher elevations are bearing the brunt of this transformation, with 314 lakes expanding rapidly between 4,000-5,000 meters and 296 above 5,000 meters. The majority of these burgeoning lakes are Moraine-dammed, their waters impounded by moraine deposits left behind by retreating glaciers.

As the relentless thaw continues, glacial lakes will continue to grow, their presence casting a long shadow over the mountain communities they threaten. It is a stark reminder that the impacts of climate change are not distant threats but present-day realities that demand immediate action and adaptation.
