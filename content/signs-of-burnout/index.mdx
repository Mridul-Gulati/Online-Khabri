## Signs You Might Be Experiencing Burnout 😓

### 1. Chronic Fatigue 💤
If you’re feeling constantly tired, even after a full night’s sleep, this could be a sign of burnout. Exhaustion that doesn’t go away with rest is one of the key indicators.

---

### 2. Sleep Issues 😴
Burnout often causes disruptions in sleep. Whether it's trouble falling asleep, waking up frequently, or feeling unrefreshed, your sleep cycle can take a major hit.

### 3. Concentration Problems 💭
Struggling to focus on tasks or making simple decisions can be another clear sign of burnout. Your brain may feel foggy, making it hard to concentrate on your coding tasks.

> **Tip:** Try using productivity apps like **Trello** or **Todoist** to break down tasks and keep your focus in check.

---

### 4. Increased Irritability 😡
Are you finding yourself more easily frustrated? Increased irritability is common during burnout, especially when you feel overwhelmed by the smallest tasks.

---

### 5. Loss of Interest 🖥️
If activities you once loved, like coding or learning new frameworks, no longer excite you, burnout could be the culprit. This emotional disconnection can creep in over time.

---

### 6. Physical Symptoms 🤒
Burnout doesn’t just affect your mind. You might experience headaches, gastrointestinal issues, or muscle pain due to prolonged stress.

### 7. Emotional Exhaustion 😥
Feeling emotionally drained and overwhelmed by even minor challenges is another sign. This emotional fatigue makes it hard to engage fully with your work.

### 8. Detachment 🤖
Burnout can cause you to feel disconnected from your work, colleagues, or even personal life. If you’re just going through the motions at work without feeling involved, this is a red flag.

### 10. Cynicism 👎
Developing a negative attitude towards your job, colleagues, or projects is a hallmark of burnout. If you find yourself becoming more cynical, it’s time to take action.
