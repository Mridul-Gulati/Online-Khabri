[Priyanka Chopra Jonas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priyanka_Chopra), the enigmatic beauty who has made India proud on the global stage, has always been a woman of purpose.

Growing up in India, Priyanka was fascinated by the captivating reign of Sushmita Sen and Aishwarya Rai as Miss World and Miss Universe in 1994. Their triumphs ignited a curious spark within her, but she never aspired to follow in their footsteps. "It was like, 'Wow, look at these extraordinary women doing incredible things,' but I never thought of myself as one of them," she recalled.

## Destiny's Call
