## Concerns Linger Over Iran-Israel Conflict

This week promises to be eventful for financial markets amid lingering concerns about a potential clash between Iran and Israel. Market analysts caution that if hostilities intensify, it could trigger panic selling and heighten volatility in global stock markets.

## Technical Outlook for Nifty50

> "Nifty has exhibited resilience by holding its 100-DMA and bouncing back from lows of 21,777. While 22,300 poses an immediate hurdle, 22,525 remains the next resistance level. A slip below 22,000 could expose the 100-DMA around 21,700."

*observed Pravesh Gour of Swastika Investmart.*

> "In the absence of strong positive catalysts, volatility is likely to persist. Investors should focus on stock-specific opportunities during this earnings season,"

*commented Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal.*

> "Technically, Nifty faces resistance at 22,300-350. A decisive break above this zone would signal a resurgence of bullish sentiment," 

*noted Tejas Shah of JM Financial and BlinkX.*
