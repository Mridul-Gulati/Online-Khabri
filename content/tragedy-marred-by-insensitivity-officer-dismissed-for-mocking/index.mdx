## Officer's Cruel Dismissal

In the wake of a tragic incident that claimed the life of an Indian student last year, a Seattle police officer has been removed from service for his appalling conduct. Jahnavi Kandula's (23) untimely death, the result of being struck by a police vehicle, has been overshadowed by the heartless and disparaging comments made by Officer Daniel Auderer.

Interim Chief Sue Rahr's decision to dismiss Auderer was driven by his "cruel comments and callous laughter," which she asserted had inflicted immeasurable pain on Kandula's family. She emphasized that such behavior had eroded public trust in the police force.

## A Moment of Unforgivable Indifference

On the fateful day of the accident, Auderer was tasked with assessing the incident as Kandula lay critically injured. Bodycam footage has captured his chilling remarks, made during a call with a colleague.

Auderer's disdainful words, "Yeah, just write a cheque. Just, yeah (laughter), $11,000. She was 26, anyway. She had limited value," were met with a four-second burst of laughter.

## A Deeper Pain for Kandula's Family

Kandula's family, already reeling from the loss of their beloved daughter, has been forced to endure the additional agony of hearing such heartless mockery. Their pain is compounded by the realization that the officer entrusted with investigating their daughter's death showed such utter disregard for her life and dignity.

## A Betrayal of Public Trust

The Seattle Police Department has a duty to protect and serve all its citizens, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background. Auderer's behavior has violated this fundamental principle, causing deep mistrust within the community.

Chief Rahr acknowledged that Auderer's actions have "damaged the department's reputation and undermined our ability to build relationships with the communities we serve."

## A Call for Accountability and Change

The dismissal of Auderer should serve as a wake-up call for all law enforcement agencies. It is essential to address systemic issues within police departments that allow such insensitivity to flourish.

The public deserves transparency and accountability from the police force it entrusts with its safety. Officers must be held to the highest ethical standards and those who fail to uphold them must face swift consequences.
