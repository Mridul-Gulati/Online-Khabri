## Challenges and Triumphs

Probing promethium's secrets has been a formidable task. The element is highly radioactive and exists only in small amounts. However, scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have overcome these obstacles, creating the purest sample in history for study.

## A Methodical Approach

To achieve this remarkable feat, researchers employed a novel method to separate promethium-147 from nuclear reactor waste. They then combined it with a ligand, a molecular "trap," to form a stable complex in water.
