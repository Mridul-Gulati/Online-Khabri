## Unveiling a New Side to Vicky Kaushal

Fresh off the heels of his gripping performance in 'Sam Bahadur,' Vicky Kaushal is poised to unveil a completely different facet in the upcoming comedy 'Bad News.' Departing from his usual intense roles, Kaushal ventures into uncharted territory for the first time.

## A Tale of Unconventional Parenthood

'Bad News' presents a unique and provocative story: Triptii Dimri's character finds herself pregnant with twins by two different fathers, Vicky Kaushal and Ammy Virk. This extraordinary case of heteropaternal superfecundation forms the backbone of the film's intriguing narrative.

## Stellar Cast and Creator Collaboration

The film boasts an impressive cast that includes Kaushal, Dimri, and Punjabi heartthrob Virk. Backed by Karan Johar's production prowess and directed by the talented Anand Tiwari, 'Bad News' promises a hilarious and heartwarming cinematic experience.

## Pre-Release Buzz Generates Optimism

Anticipation for the film has been building steadily, with tickets selling briskly. As of now, nearly 37000 tickets have been snapped up, amassing a pre-release revenue of over Rs 1.04 crore. Mumbai and Delhi are leading the charge in ticket sales, indicating strong regional appeal.

## Potential Roadblocks and Expectations

While the film's novel concept has piqued interest, trade analysts anticipate that its reception in smaller cities may be hindered by its unconventional theme. However, the film's strength lies in its cast's comic chemistry and catchy soundtrack, which includes chart-toppers like "Tauba Tauba" and "Mere Mehboob Mere Sanam."

Industry experts project a double-digit opening day collection, with the possibility of a strong first-weekend performance buoyed by positive word-of-mouth.
