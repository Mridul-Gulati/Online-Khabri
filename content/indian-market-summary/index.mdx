The Indian equity markets commenced the week with a positive start on Tuesday, extending the rally from the previous session's record highs. The benchmark indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty50, opened in the green, indicating continued investor optimism.

## Domestic Factors

The domestic markets drew strength from the positive sentiments seen in the previous week. The Sensex touched close to 80,800, while the Nifty50 held steady above 24,600. Experts believe that the near-term trend remains bullish, suggesting potential gains towards 24,950 in the coming week.

## Global Cues

International markets also contributed to the positive sentiment. S&P 500 futures edged higher by 0.1%, while Hang Seng futures slipped by 1%. Japan's Topix gained 0.3%, but Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.1%. Euro Stoxx 50 futures faced a decline of 1.3%.

## Outlook and Analysis

Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities asserts that the positive momentum is expected to continue, with support at the 24,450 level. Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking recommends a "buy on dips" strategy, suggesting that investors should take advantage of potential price declines. Global factors, particularly the Fed's potential interest rate cut in September, are also boosting confidence.

## Forex and Commodities

The forex market witnessed stability, with the euro, Japanese yen, and offshore yuan maintaining their positions against the US dollar. Oil prices faced a slight dip due to concerns over China's economic slowdown, but expectations of a Fed rate cut limited the decline. Brent futures traded at 
84.76 per barrel, while WTI crude hovered around 81.78.

## Corporate Earnings

Market participants eagerly await the first-quarter results of several companies, including Bajaj Auto, L&T Finance, and Just Dial, which could provide further insights into the broader corporate landscape.
