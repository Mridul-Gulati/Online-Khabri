In the heart of picturesque Thanamandi, a grim tragedy unfolded on Monday night, casting a long shadow over the upcoming election. The cold-blooded murder of Mohammad Razaq, the brother of Territorial Army soldier Mohammad Tahir Choudhary, has sent shockwaves through the village and beyond.

## The Terror continues
Police investigations have pointed to the deadly hand of Lashkar-e-Taiba, with one of the perpetrators identified as a foreign operative known as Abu Hamza. A seasoned terrorist with a trail of blood behind him, Hamza is believed to be the architect of this horrific attack.

As the evidence mounts, police have taken swift action, releasing posters bearing Hamza's image and offering a substantial reward for information leading to his arrest. The hunt for both the assailants is in full swing, with a massive joint operation launched by police and Army.

## Tragedy in Thanamandi
Tragically, Mohammad Tahir Choudhary, the intended target, narrowly escaped the terrorists' bullets. His brother, however, was not so fortunate. Critically wounded, Razaq succumbed to his injuries en route to a nearby hospital.

The brutal attack has brought back painful memories for the bereaved family. Nineteen years ago, terrorists took the life of Razaq's father in the same village. The compassionate embrace of the J&K government had secured a job for Razaq in the social welfare department, but fate had a cruel twist in store for him.

As the sun sets on Thanamandi, the scars of the attack remain fresh. The community is united in its grief and determination to seek justice. The posters with Hamza's face are haunting reminders of the insidious threat that lingers in their midst.

## Conclusion

The attack in Rajouri is a chilling reminder of the sinister forces that seek to disrupt the democratic process. As the nation prepares to exercise its electoral rights, vigilance and unity are paramount. The search for the perpetrators must continue relentlessly, and those responsible must be brought to swift justice.
